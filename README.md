# General Description

With this repository certain processes are automated, you have the choice between "full_install", which is aimed at a Kali installation with GUI and "minimal_install", which is aimed at the CLI variant.

## How to download and install the tool
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jarl-Bjoern/Kali_Configurator/
cd Kali_Configurator
chmod +x *.sh ; dos2unix *.sh Config/*
```

## How to use the tool

sudo bash install.sh


```

It should be said that the scripts are still under development, but already allow an easier start to perform as a penetration tester, certain pre-settings.
