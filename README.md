# Script to install and configurate kali after the installation

With this repository certain processes are automated, you have the choice between "full_install", which is aimed at a Kali installation with GUI and "minimal_install", which is aimed at the CLI variant.

## How to download and install the tool
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jarl-Bjoern/Kali_Configurator/
cd Kali_Configuratior
chmod +x *.sh
```

## Troubleshooting
In some cases you must try to convert the script from Windows (DOS) into the Unix Format
```bash
dos2unix *.sh
```
It should be said that the scripts are still under development, but already allow an easier start to perform as a penetration tester, certain pre-settings.
