# Kali_Configurator

With this repository certain processes are automated, you have the choice between "full_install", which is aimed at a Kali installation with GUI and "minimal_install", which is aimed at the CLI variant.

It should be said that the scripts are still under development, but already allow an easier start to perform as a penetration tester, certain pre-settings.
